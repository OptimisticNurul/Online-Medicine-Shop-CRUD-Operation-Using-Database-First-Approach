# Online Medicine Shop CRUD Operation Using Database First Approach

The Online Medicine Shop is a web application developed using ASP.NET MVC that allows users to manage medicines, manufacturers, and inventories online. It provides functionalities for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on medicines, including inventory management and authentication.

## Features

- **Medicine Management:** Users can add, edit, and delete medicines with details such as name, manufacturing date, manufacturer, dosage form, and inventory.
- **Manufacturer Management:** Functionality for managing manufacturers, including adding, editing, and deleting manufacturer details.
- **Inventory Management:** Users can manage medicine inventory, including dosage form, price, and quantity.
- **Authentication:** User authentication and authorization features are included to secure the application.
- **Responsive Design:** The web application is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several components organized into controllers, models, and views:

- **Controllers:** Contains the logic for handling user requests and generating responses.
- **Models:** Defines the data structures used by the application, including entities like Medicine, Manufacturer, and Inventory.
- **Views:** Contains the HTML templates rendered by the controllers to display the user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET MVC:** Used as the primary framework for building the web application.
- **Entity Framework:** Utilized for data access and database management.
- **C#:** Primary programming language used for backend development.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Used for frontend development and user interface design.
